#Gameplay Advice


##A. What advice should every new GM/Player be aware of?

There’s a lot to be said about GMing Burning Wheel for the first time. So, here are some of the more helpful ideas that you should keep in mind:



1. Try to avoid having pre-conceived notions regarding what’s going to happen in the game. Beliefs, and Intent and Task drive the story forward, not narration. Prep is generally unnecessary and usually counter-productive in Burning Wheel.

2. Make sure that your players understand that they are just as responsible for the story as you are and are comfortable with this responsibility. Make sure they understand that their Intents give them narrative authority.



3. Don’t try to simulate the game world. Rather, focus on setting up scenes that are relevant to the story and to the players’ Beliefs. If what’s happening or about to happen is boring and/or tangential, then skip it, and move on to something that’s interesting and relevant.



4. Stick to the Hub & Spokes until everyone is comfortable with the core system. Fight!, Duel of Wits, and the rest of The Rim is interesting and tempting to use. But it relies on the concepts contained within the Hub & Spokes to function properly.



5. Presenting interesting failure conditions is essential to using Intent and Task. Failure doesn’t necessarily mean that the player doesn’t get what they want. But it does need to push the story in a compelling direction that leads to potential conflict. Players should feel like they are taking a real risk when they roll the dice. Failure is what produces this tension.



6. Make sure you have a strong situation and world that everyone at the table is invested in before you start to play. Beliefs can’t drive the story if there’s nothing compelling the characters and the players to act.



7. Don’t expect your players to have a perfect perspective on the system right away. Burning Wheel’s mechanics can be tough to wrap your head around at first, and this is especially true for players who are coming from more traditional systems. Be patient and ready to explain things more than once. None of Burning Wheel’s mechanics are very complicated individually. But seeing how they work together can take time.



8. Don’t forget to “Say Yes or Roll the Dice.” Also don’t forget to “Let It Ride.”



9. Plan for your first and possibly your second session to be devoted entirely to setting up the game and creating characters. Don’t just jump in.



10. Challenge your players’ Beliefs. Think of ways to dig in and make them feel like they are taking real risks. Don’t let them off easy. Make them fight for what they believe.



11. Try to make sure that your players craft Beliefs that are more than just a goal or a statement. They should say something about what motivates the character. Why have they sworn to kill the king?



12. Be ready to create NPCs on the fly. No need to flesh them out all at once. But be prepared to throw together stats and skills that may be relevant in the moment.

##B. How do I write good Beliefs?

First, Beliefs are about what the player wants for the game and how they wanted to be rewarded for playing--They're player priorities. So, the best Beliefs are those that push your game towards being the game you want to play and do so in an interesting and compelling way. Good Beliefs are written in the context of the action at-hand and reflect the situation that the game is exploring. Good Beliefs say something about the character--”I am the greatest knight in all the land!”--and then describe an action that is driven by this statement--”I will prove my greatness by slaying the monstrous beast that plagues the moors!” Or good Beliefs reflect a core tenant of the character’s personality that you want to test and potentially change--”If I am going to be a good man, I must be a selfless man.” Good Beliefs should overlap with each other as little as possible, so they can generate as much Artha as possible and so that they avoid repeating each other. Good Beliefs should drive the character into conflict, personal growth and change, and gut-wrenching decisions. Often, good Beliefs will be in direct conflict with each other!

It takes practice and experience to be able to easily craft good Beliefs. These are solid, practical examples and discussion of how to write good Beliefs:

##C. How do I write good Instincts?

Instincts, like Beliefs, should reflect the player’s priorities for the game. But they do so in a different and more mechanical way.

(**Thoughts or links for this? Instincts always seem so amorphous to me. Help.**)



##D. How do I determine which Obstacle to use?

Some skills provide examples and/or their own specific criteria for setting the obstacle. These should be used first, if they’re available. Next, you should look to the list of Obstacle descriptions on page 15 in Gold. Your goal as the GM is to pick the Obstacle that most closely matches the difficulty of performing the Task at hand relative to the game world itself (not the character). Obstacle 6 is the upper-bound of what a normal, human person could accomplish. Obstacles 1 & 2 are the simple sort of things we do every day. When the Obstacle completely eludes you, go with Obstacle 3. Statistically, Obstacle 3 offers a good compromise between difficulty and tension (That's why it's Luke's favorite!).



##E. How can I be a better player?

Players have a lot of responsibilities in Burning Wheel. Here are some thoughts on how you can better live up to your responsibilities as a player:



1. [Create testable moments](https://www.burningwheel.com/forum/showthread.php?1990-Creating-quot-testable-quot-moments-as-a-player). It’s the GM’s job to test your Beliefs. But that doesn’t meant that the GM should be the only one setting those moments up! Propose Intents that drive your Beliefs forward, and then watch as the GM proposes a failure condition that makes you gnash your teeth at the choice laid out before you.



2. Craft meaningful and actionable Beliefs. Beliefs are your chance as the player to say “THIS is what I want to be rewarded for playing towards. THIS is what’s cool. THIS is what’s important and interesting to me.” It’s your responsibility to tell the GM what interests you and what the game should be about. Take it seriously.



3. Propose Intents and Tasks that drive the game forward in relevant and interesting ways. Don’t test monger. Intents are your chance as the player to narrate the story. This is an enormous power. Don’t squander it.



4. Engage with the story. It’s your job to say what the story is about, so why wouldn’t you want to engage with it? The GM isn’t there to narrate to you. If you aren’t engaging with the narrative, then the narrative has nowhere to go. And if you find yourself bored by the action at-hand, say so.



5. Engage with the mechanics. If you aren’t engaging with the mechanics, then the cycle of Beliefs, Artha, advancement, and narrative isn’t spinning. It’s your job to make the game turn mechanically.



6. Strive to learn and to know the rules. Nothing in Burning Wheel works if you don’t understand the relationships between the game’s various systems. It’s a lot to learn, but take each system one-at-a-time. Once you see how they feed into and work with one another, you’ll appreciate their elegance.

(**This is more than I want to answer alone. Again, thoughts?**)



##G. How can I get into the right mindset for Burning Wheel?

First, understand that Burning Wheel is a game that is solely concerned with telling a story. Simulation, tactics, and even the characters themselves are simply tools that are used to drive the storytelling engine at the heart of the game forward. Characters are manifestations of what the players want the story to be about. Think about them as such rather than as self-inserts or perspectives from which to experience the story. Play Burning Wheel as a player, not as your character.

[Here’s a thread](http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1182) discussing how to shift from the hack’n’slash mindset to the Burning Wheel mindset.

[Here’s a thread showing how the wrong mindset can make a game stagnate.](https://www.burningwheel.com/forum/showthread.php?1915-Help-me-make-Advancement-the-Lifeblood-of-my-game) Luke makes some suggestions regarding how to fix this.

(**Again, I feel like there's more to say here that would benefit from multiple perspectives. Thoughts?**)

##H. What’s the best way to engage with Character Traits?

Character traits are best engaged with situationally. When you see the chance to bring up your “Maggot Lover” trait in a way that changes the story in a cool and interesting way, don’t hesitate to do so. But also don’t forget to let them shape and flavor your roleplay.
