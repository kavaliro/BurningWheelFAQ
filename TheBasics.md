# The Basics


## A. What is Burning Wheel, and why should I play it?


Straight from the Burning Wheel wiki:

“The Burning Wheel is an award winning fantasy roleplaying game written by Luke Crane, in which players take on the roles of vibrant, dynamic characters whose very beliefs drive the story forward.

Starting with a simple d6 die pool mechanic, this game intuitively builds on its core concepts, evoking a pitch and tenor in play uncommon in roleplaying games. It details solid, dramatic systems for task resolution, advancement, trials of belief, tests of nerve, searing social conflict, dangerous sorcery, miraculous faith, and brutal, gut-wrenching martial combat. Behind the dice, player decisions drive the game's systems. The choices tangibly affect every outcome, from glorious victory to ignominious defeat.”

Burning Wheel is a tabletop roleplaying game that prioritizes narrative, dramatic conflict, character arcs, and player authorship over more traditional tabletop RPG tropes and mechanics. Burning Wheel is an engine for telling cool stories. Every aspect of the system is geared towards creating a compelling, dynamic, player-driven narrative wrapped in a game that pushes players to engage with the conflicts that drive that narrative. In Burning Wheel, you fight for your beliefs.

## B. What is the setting for Burning Wheel?

Burning Wheel has no official setting and is intended to be applied to original settings created by those playing the game. The material included with Burning Wheel Gold has the flavor of 13th Century France or Tolkien’s Middle Earth. But these are rough comparisons at best, and the material is meant to a source from which to draw and build your own worlds. There are also several alternate settings available for the game from Burning Wheel HQ:

*The Blossoms are Falling* is a setting for a mythical 12th Century Japan. This is out-of-print and somewhat hard to find.

*Burning Sands: Jihad* is a setting inspired by Dune and similar sci-fi literature. This is available for free [on the Burning Wheel Wiki](https://www.burningwheel.com/wiki/index.php?title=File:Jihad.pdf).

## C. What are the basic mechanics of Burning Wheel?

[The Hub & Spokes](https://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/free-pdfs/burning-wheel-gold-hub-and-spokes.html) explain the basic mechanics used to play Burning Wheel. This is a summary of those mechanics:

### Tests

“Test” is Burning Wheel lingo for a dice roll used to determine an outcome. Tests are part of the Intent and Task mechanic described below. When you test in Burning Wheel, you’re rolling your dice pool to achieve a number of successes equal to or greater than the number needed to achieve the thing you want to happen--e.g. To win the fight! Your dice pool is a combination of the character's level in a skill, called the Exponent, plus advantages and modifiers. The number of necessary successes is called the Obstacle, which is the base number of successes needed (usually set by the GM), plus any disadvantages. If the number of successes you roll with your dice pool is equal to or greater than the Obstacle for the test, then you succeed; if not, then you fail. A die is a success if it meets or exceeds the difficulty number, which is most often 4. Dice that aren’t successes are called “traitors."

There are four types of tests in Burning Wheel:


**Standard Tests**: The GM sets the obstacle

**Versus Tests**: Your opponent’s successes are the obstacle, and vice versa

**Graduated Tests**: More successes mean greater reward, so the obstacle is 1 by default

**Linked Tests**: Multiple, related tests in a row help or hinder one another


### Intent and Task


Intent and Task is the mechanic for resolving actions in Burning Wheel. It’s the core of the game. Players act in Burning Wheel by narrating an Intent that describes something they want to happen in the story, and then they describe the Task their character will engage in to achieve this Intent.

An Intent is formed when a player describes something they would like to happen:

Player: “I want my character to escape from the guards who are chasing him.”

How an Intent is achieved is described by the Task for that Intent. Tasks are the specific action(s) that a character takes to bring about an Intent:

GM: “How will he escape from the guards?”
 Player: “He’ll pick the lock of the store room nearby and slip in unseen.”

If the GM can think of an interesting, relevant, alternative outcome to the player’s Intent, then the player tests to see if they achieve the Intent they described or if the GM-presented alternative comes to pass. If there is no interesting, potential failure condition, then the player achieves their Intent without testing. This is called “**Roll the Dice or Say Yes.” (pg. 72) Successful Intents come to pass exactly as they are described.

The skill, stat, or attribute (collectively known as “abilities”) that is used if a test occurs is determined by the player’s description of their character’s Task. There may be multiple abilities that could be appropriate for a test. It’s the GM’s job to decide which is the most appropriate.

GM: “That  sounds like Lockpicking to me.”
Player: “Yeah, I agree.”

The GM makes the potential failure condition for a roll explicit before the roll occurs. The player’s decision to roll or not roll is made after they understand and accept the failure condition offered by GM. (pg. 32)

GM: “If you fail, the guards are going to see you slip inside, and you’ll be trapped in the store room.”
Player: “That sounds fair. I’ll roll.”

The obstacle is then set, the roll is made, the outcome is described, and the story progresses to the next Intent and Task.


### Beliefs

In Burning Wheel, each character has three Beliefs, which serve three purposes: to characterize, to describe goals for the character, and to state how the player wants to be rewarded for playing the character. Beliefs are are a type of player priority for the game--they tell the GM what the game should be about. Beliefs direct the GM in how to shape and steer the game’s events and when to call for tests.

For example, if a character has the Belief “Mr. Frodo cannot make this journey alone. I will do what I must to keep him safe,” then it is the GM’s job to create situations in the game that force the player to make decisions, take actions, and engage in tests that compel the character to keep Mr. Frodo safe until this Belief has been satisfactorily explored. The player has told the GM through this Belief that keeping Mr. Frodo safe is important to the character and interesting to the player. In this way, the player defines the focus and direction of a game and is rewarded (with Artha) for engaging with the narrative through the system’s mechanics.


### Instincts

Instincts, like Beliefs, are player priorities for the game. Instincts, however, describe how a character acts, rather who a character is or what they want. Instincts define a condition and reaction in which a character’s actions are to be assumed. Every character has up to three Instincts chosen by the player. Instincts are best phrased as “Always,” “Never,” or “If/Then” statements. For example, “Always catch objects thrown at me.” “Never drink something I didn’t pour myself.”

The condition and reaction that an Instinct defines occurs whether it is explicitly stated to have done so or not. If an object is thrown at the character with the Instinct above, the character will have always have a chance to test to catch the thrown object, even if this test must be made retroactively. In this way, Instincts allow the player to create mechanical assurances for certain character behaviors in-game. These assurances hold even to the point of circumventing the game’s mechanics. If a character’s Instinct is “Always have an arrow nocked,” then if they were to engage with the Fight! (advanced combat) mechanics, they would be able to fire their bow in two actions instead of the usual seven, for example (It takes five actions to nock an arrow).


### Traits

Traits define a character’s most prominent aspects. They state what makes a character different from his peers. There are three types of traits, each with unique mechanics:


**Character Traits**

Character traits highlight something about a character that is particularly prominent. If a character has the “Pompous” character trait, then they are pompous with a capital “P,” and everyone can see it. Character traits inform how a character should be roleplayed. But the player can choose to play towards a character trait and exemplify it, or they can choose to play against a character trait as that character struggles to change and rid themself of it.


**Die Traits**

Die traits, like character traits, describe a character. But they do so primarily in a mechanical way. Every die trait uniquely modifies how a character functions within the game system. They grant new abilities, create unique advantages or disadvantages, add or subtract dice from tests, or define any number of other unique ways in which a character can interact with the system. 

Examples of die traits:
 
- No Sense of Smell - “Never test to resist disgusting smells"

- Marksman - "+1D to all Bow and Throwing tests"

- Condescending - "+1Ob to social tests against you, but also +1Ob when using Instruction"

**Call-On Traits**

Call-on traits reflect a particular edge that a character has over others. Call-on traits are tied to a specific ability or abilities, and, once per session, they allow a player to reroll a failed test or break a tie (from a versus test) in their favor.


A character’s traits change over the course of a game via the Trait Vote mechanic, which allows traits to be added or removed from a character’s sheet according to how that character has been played during the game.


### Artha

In Burning Wheel, players are rewarded for engaging the system with their Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits and by roleplaying the drama and conflict that arises during the game with points called “Artha.” There are three types of Artha: Fate, Persona, and Deeds. Each has particular effects when spent in the game, and each is earned in different ways.


**Fate**

Fate points are earned by playing towards Beliefs, creating problems for a character with an Instinct, sending the story in an unforeseen or difficult direction with a Trait, creating humor at the table, or by having just the right skill at just the right time. Fate can be spent to open-end (explode) sixes after a roll has been made, or it can be used to temporarily ignore a minor wound.


**Persona**

Persona points are earned by achieving goals set out in Beliefs, roleplaying a dramatic moment particularly well, showing a character’s inner turmoil believably and vividly, being the central gear that drives a scenario forward, or being the game’s MVP. Persona points can be spent in a number of ways, but the most common is to add +1D (up to +3D) to a roll before it is made.


**Deeds**

Deeds points are earned by performing actions that create benefits beyond a character’s personal goals for reasons that go beyond personal gain, or by helping another character achieve goals that are completely opposed to a character’s own goals, Beliefs, or Instincts. Earning a Deeds point must cost a character dearly in some way. Deeds points allow for a player to double the exponent for a single test or to reroll all the failed dice on a single test.

Artha is intimately tied to advancement via the Epiphany mechanic. Over many sessions and many Artha points spent, a character can eventually shift the shade of an ability, and so lower its difficult number.

Artha points are usually awarded at the end of each session of play. In this way, Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits are tied directly into the economy of the game’s dice mechanics and character advancement.


### Advancement

In Burning Wheel, character advancement involves increasing a character’s individual stats, attributes, and skills. There are no levels, and there is no XP. Whenever a test is made, pass or fail, that test counts towards advancing the ability (stat, attribute, or skill) rolled for the test. The only exceptions to this rule are Perception, Resources, and Faith, which require successful tests.

Tests are rated according to three levels of difficulty: routine, difficult, and challenging. These ratings are determined by comparing a test’s dice pool to its obstacle. The higher the obstacle is in comparison to the number of dice being rolled against it, the more difficult the test is considered to be. Each level of difficulty is needed to advance an ability. A dozen challenging tests won’t eliminate the need for routine tests. Advancement requires a mixture of routine, difficult, and challenging tests.

So, by engaging a character’s Beliefs and Instincts through the Intent and Task mechanic, player are able to advance their character every time they roll the dice.


### The Game

Together, these elements form the core mechanics of Burning Wheel. Players look to their Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits to form Intents and Tasks to make tests that help them advance their characters’ skills, attributes, and stats while driving the narrative forward. They are rewarded with Artha, which, along with advancing their abilities, helps them succeed in future tests. And so the game progresses.

## D. What do I need to play Burning Wheel?

Burning Wheel is currently in its third iteration: Burning Wheel Gold, which was published in 2011. Burning Wheel Gold was preceded by Burning Wheel Classic and Burning Wheel Revised. At present, the only thing necessary to play Burning Wheel--other than dice and people--is the Hub & Spokes, which is available for free as a [PDF from the Burning Wheel Store](https://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/free-pdfs/burning-wheel-gold-hub-and-spokes.html). 

The Burning Wheel Gold book contains the Hub & Spokes and adds the Character Burner, which explains and details the process for creating characters for Burning Wheel using the Lifepath system and adds lists of skills and traits to use in-game. It also includes The Rim, which details advanced systems for conflict resolution, injury and treatment, weapons and armor, sorcery, and other specific sub-systems. 

Although the game can be played with just the Hub & Spokes, the additional systems included in the Gold book are normally used for play with the basic rules that the Hub & Spokes describe.

Also, parts of the supplements from Burning Wheel Revised--The Monster Burner, The Magic Burner, and The Adventure Burner--are currently being condensed and collected into the Burning Wheel Codex after a successful Kickstarter campaign that ended in February 2016. These supplements contain content that expands Burning Wheel’s magic systems, stocks, and other aspects of the game. They also include the Commentary, which is a text that explains the system, how to run and play it, and the philosophy behind it in greater detail than what is found in Gold. The Codex is currently slated for release in August 2016 along with the fifth printing of Burning Wheel Gold.


## E. Where can I buy Burning Wheel and its supplemental content?

## F. What are some basic resources I should be aware of as a new player?


[Charred](https://charred.herokuapp.com/#/) is an online tool for character burning (character creation) that helps simplify and streamline this process immensely.

[The Burning Wheel Wiki](https://burningwheel.com/wiki) is a somewhat outdated but very useful collection of all things Burning Wheel. The [Downloads section](https://burningwheel.com/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads) in particular contains many sheets and references for use in play.

[The Official Forums](https://burningwheel.com/forum) are an excellent resource for interacting with the Burning Wheel community, including the game’s creators. Although the official forums are less active than they once were, their archives contain a wealth of Burning Wheel discussion that spans well over a decade.

[Roll20](https://roll20.net/) works well for playing Burning Wheel online and has a custom sheet for the game.

G+ has an [active Burning Wheel community](https://plus.google.com/communities/101955942573794985122).
