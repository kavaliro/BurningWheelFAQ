##A. How do I add custom races to Burning Wheel, and is this a simple process?

Creating custom stocks (races) is covered in The Monster Burner. However, The Monster Burner isn’t necessary for this process; it just simplifies it.

 (**Anyone with experience doing this or links to good discussions about it? I can’t speak to it.**)



##B. How do I add custom Lifepaths to Burning Wheel, and is this a simple process?

Creating custom Lifepaths is covered in The Monster Burner. However, The Monster isn’t necessary for this process; it just simplifies it. To create a custom Lifepath without following the steps outlined in The Monster Burner, simply take an existing Lifepath and use it as a template for the Lifepath you want to create. Find a Lifepath that’s close to your concept and mimic it. Then tweak the result to add the finishing touches that bring it fully in-line with what you need. Lifepaths are supposed to present hard choices to the player, not be a direct path to a set character-type.



##C. How can I convert an entire setting to Burning Wheel?

With a lot of time and effort. Converting an entire setting requires Lifepaths, stocks, skills, traits, and mechanics to be reconsidered and revised. If you really want to attempt this, check out some of these total conversions for inspiration:

##D. What are some good, alternative settings to use for Burning Wheel?

Other than the official alternative settings, these are cool:

#Alternative Rules



##A. What are some alternative ways to implement practice?

[Fuseboy and others discuss breaking down Practice by days, rather than hours.](https://www.burningwheel.com/forum/showthread.php?11787-Simplified-Practice&p=119444#post119444)

[Dwight and Fuseboy discuss rolling Will for Practice tests.](https://www.burningwheel.com/forum/showthread.php?13055-Simplified-Practice-%282%29/page2)

(**Anything else to say about this? Anything to add /u/fuseboy?**)

##B. Can Torchbearer and Burning Wheel be combined?

(**Maybe? I’ve never seen them successfully combined, and most people say it doesn’t work, including the people who would know. Maybe /u/tolavsrud has a better answer.**)



##c. Can Epiphanies be eliminated from play?

Can they be eliminated? Sure. Should they be eliminated? Probably not. Epiphanies don’t come up in Burning Wheel, except in very long-running campaigns. But the function they serve as motivation for playing a character over such a significant period of time is an important part of rewarding players for their effort. They provides a long-term, mechanical goal for which to aim. Don’t discount their value.


##D. What’s Thor’s hack for Resources tax?
