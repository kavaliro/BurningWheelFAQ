#Rules Clarifications



##A. What are Circles, and how do they work?

Circles are an Attribute in Burning Wheel that allows a player to introduce an NPC their character would know or know of into the game world. Who a character would know is determined by their Lifepaths and the Settings associated with those Lifepaths. A scholar will know other scholars and city dwellers, and he can roll his Circles to bring them into the game. But he won’t know bandits, slaves, or clergy unless he also has Lifepaths related to those types of people.

The Circles rules are found on pages 377-387 of Gold.



##B. How does Practice work?

Practice allows characters to spend time in-game that isn’t covered by the narrative practicing skills or stats in order to gain credit towards tests for those skills or stats. Tasks that are resolved without a test may also be counted as Practice for the relevant skill. The rules for Practice can be found on pages 47-49 in Gold. This includes charts that list specific amounts of time that must be spent to gain tests from Practice. Instruction is a type of Practice that (of course) involves an instructor. This is a more direct and efficient form of practice, and its rules can be found on pages 50-51 in Gold.



##C. What are Emotional Attributes, and how do they work?

Emotional Attributes are a mechanic in Burning Wheel that are meant to reflect the power of deep emotion. Emotional Attributes grant a character access to various abilities specific to the idiom they reflect (e.g. Faith allows a character to pray for miracles), but they do so at the potential cost of that character’s life. All the stocks in Gold other than Man come with an Emotional Attribute by default. Emotional Attributes advance like skills and are often rolled like skills. But once they reach Exponent 10, the character is removed from play. All Emotional Attributes are open-ended if they are rolled.

##D. What is Faith, and how does it work?

Faith is an Emotional Attribute particular to Men and Roden (found in The Monster Burner) that deals with religious magic. Faith allows a character to beseech their prefered divine entity for miracles. Intent and Task is still used when Faith is called upon. The prayer is the Task, while the miraculous outcome and its effects are the Intent. The idioms of Faith are specific to the game they are used in and the character they are used by. Faith is open-ended.

 The rules for Faith can be found on pages 522-527 in Gold.



##E. What is Greed, and how does it work?

Greed is an Emotional Attribute particular to Dwarves that reflects the innate tendency of every Dwarf to covet and to seek out the objects of their desires. Greed advances like any other Emotional Attribute, but it is never rolled. Instead, it advances when the Dwarf experiences situations that appeal to his or her Greed. A character’s Greed exponent may be added to the dice pool in certain situations by tapping a Persona point. Greed can also cause a character to hesitate when they see something that sparks their greedy nature, such as a pile of gold coins.

The rules for Greed can be found on pages 121-124 in Gold.



##F. What is Grief, and how does it work?

Grief is an Emotional Attribute particular to Elves that reflects the compounding of tragedies that weighs heavy on immortal beings. Grief advances like any other Emotional Attribute, but it is not rolled. Instead, it advances when an Elf experiences a situation that reminds them of the failures and evils of the world they occupy. Grief can be mitigated when an Elf sings to lament their grief. Grief can be used in conjunction with a Deeds point to add a character’s Grief exponent to a roll.

The rules for Grief can be found on pages 152-156 of Gold.

##G. What is Hatred, and how does it work?

Hatred is an Emotional Attribute particular to Orcs that reflects the overwhelming contempt they have for the world and everything in it. Hatred advances like any other Emotional Attribute, but it advances both based on conditions (like Greed and Grief) and also by being rolled. Hatred can, once per session, be used to summon an Orc’s Fury, which allows Hatred to be tested in place of a skill when used for an Intent involving destruction, corruption, or cowardice. Hatred can be replaced by dark Orc magic if the Orc chooses to embrace the void.

The rules for Hatred can be found on pages 239-241 in Gold. The rules for Void Embrace can be found on pages 244-250 in Gold.



##H. What is Sorcery, and how does it work?

Of the many types of magic in Burning Wheel, Sorcery is the domain of developing, researching, and casting magic spells. Sorcery is an open-ended skill that is usually limited to characters with the Gifted trait. Those who aren’t Gifted can only learn of its ways; they can’t cast spells.

 Pages 499-521 in Gold describe the rules for Sorcery. These include detailed descriptions of the eight parts of a spell and each of the ways these parts can manifest, how casting works in various circumstances, an explanation of Tax (the physical cost a wizard pays for using magic), how to handle failed casting (which is usually extremely dangerous and unpredictable), various rules for advanced uses of Sorcery, and how to create new spells. The list of spells included with the book can be found on pages 207-223 in Gold.

Sorcery is used just like any other skill--via Intent and Task. The Task is casting the spell, and the Intent is what the player wants to happen as a result of the spell being cast. Failure, however, is baked into the Sorcery rules. And so, explicit failure conditions are optional for tests involving Sorcery.



##I. How do I know what all these weird Wises mean?

Many Wises are references to obscure bits of this and that. Some are inside jokes. Some are very straightforward. There’s no best way to interpret what a Wise means. So, either reach your own conclusions, sit down and do a bit of research, or ask someone (preferably Thor)!

[Here’s a lot of info on Wises.](https://www.burningwheel.com/wiki/index.php?title=Wises)

(**I'll be breaking this link down and saying more about Wises later**)



##J. How do I convert Burning Wheel Revised weapon speeds to Burning Wheel Gold?

The conversion is approximate. But generally unwieldy = 1, slow = 2, and fast = 4.



##K. How does Two-Fisting Fighting Training work?

When a character has the Two-Fisted Fighting Training skill and attacks with two weapons simultaneously, the dice pool is divided between the two weapons for each of their individual attacks. Use the skill exponent for the longer weapon.



##L. How do Carefully, Patiently, and Quickly work?

Carefully, Patiently, and Quickly are the three methods (other than just testing normally) that a player may use for a test:

1. The Carefully method grants +1D to a test (+2D for Elves) at the cost of increasing the time for the Task by half and giving the GM the opportunity to introduce a serious failure complication related to time. A player must indicate that a test is being done Carefully prior to rolling, and it must make sense that the character would be able to spend more time on the Task at hand.

2. The Patiently method allows a player to allocate extra successes after a roll has occurred in order to add a narrative flourish to the outcome of the test. The specifics of applying this flourish are entirely circumstantial to the Intent and Task in question. Many skills also have specific rules for how extra successes may be allocated.

3. The Quickly method allows a player to allocate extra successes to decreasing the time for the Task at hand by 10% per extra success up to 30%.

These methods may be combined in any way that is appropriate to the Intent and Task being tested.



##M. How does property work with Affiliations and Reputations?

Affiliations and Reputations do not grant property. So, having a reputation as “the wealthiest landowner in the duchy” does not actually mean that you own any land in the duchy. It merely means that you have that reputation. The land itself must be purchased separately.

Conversely, buying a country villa includes the staff and stuff relevant to owning a country villa, but it doesn’t include Relationships with your staff, a Reputation as the villa’s owner, etc.

##N. What are the differences between Revised and Gold?

The differences between Burning Wheel Revised and Burning Wheel Gold are many. But the two versions describe the same system, for the most part.

(**Making a comprehensive list for this question is a project in and of itself. Help? Or at least point me in the right direction?**)



##O. What are the little ‘f’, ’p’, and ’d’ boxes next to Beliefs and Instincts for?

These boxes are for recording when Fate, Persona, and Deeds points are spent on tests that are relevant to particular Beliefs or Instincts. Artha spent on Beliefs and Instincts should be considered when discussing those Beliefs and Instincts during Trait Votes. See "Evolving Beliefs and Instincts" on page 59 in Gold.



##P. How do custom armor kits in character burning work?

Armor can be mixed and matched from different kits at the costs described at the top of page 203 in Gold. Creating a custom kit with these numbers may make the total cost seem a little high. This isn’t by accident. It’s meant to be a compromise. But don’t get bogged down by the math. If custom armor is important, work out a reasonable (but not generous) total cost and move on.



##Q. How does Disguise (or any other outcome-centric skill) work?

Disguise works just like any other skill--it’s tested when it’s relevant to the Intent and Task at hand. Don’t let yourself get caught up in the tendency to simulate. Disguise isn’t tested to make a disguise unless making that disguise is the Task to a relevant Intent. In almost all cases, you shouldn't be testing Diguise simply to make a disguise.



##R. How do the results of Duels of Wits play out long-term?

Before a Duel of Wits begins, each **player** states their ‘terms’ for the duel, which should reflect a narrative outcome they want to occur. Terms act as each side’s Intent for the conflict, while the Duel of Wits itself can be thought of as an extended Task. Much like in any other versus test, when one side is declared the winner, their Intent becomes reality. So, like any other test, the results of Duels of Wits are only binding in the context of the Let It Ride rule. They hold ”until conditions legitimately and drastically change.”



##S. When is it appropriate to award a Deeds point?

Knowing when to award a Deeds point can be tricky. There are two conditions that can trigger a Deeds point:

1. Performing actions that create benefits beyond a character’s personal goals for reasons that go beyond personal gain.

2. Helping another character achieve goals that are completely opposed to a character’s own goals, Beliefs, or Instincts.

Earning a Deeds point must cost a character dearly in some way. Save awarding Deeds points for moments of true heroism and/or enormous personal sacrifice.



##T. How do you log tests when using Bloody Versus?

Two tests are rolled in Bloody Versus (attack and defense), but only one of them is able to be counted towards advancement because this falls under the Series of Rolls rule on page 45 in Gold. For both the characters rolling and for any helpers, take the most difficult test of the two (attack v. attack and defense v. defense).



##U. How do wounds work in Bloody Versus?

Wounds in Bloody Versus work just like wounds in any other test. They are either assigned based on Intent or they’re calculated using the IMS rules.

##V. How does practice work for untrained skills?

Untrained skills can be practiced just like trained skills can be. Use the practice times for skills found on page 47 in Gold to determine how long it takes to acquire a test via practice. Remember that untrained skills need Routine tests.

It may seem like practicing untrained skills should use the times for Routine stat tests on page 48, but [Luke has clarified that this is not the case.](https://www.burningwheel.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-6660.html)

##W. What does “Total Exp” mean?

“Total Exp” in the context of burning characters refers to the total exponent of a skill when calculating its root plus any skill points spent on it.



##X. What are Resources and how do they work?

Resources are an abstraction of a character’s total wealth. Burning Wheel isn’t concerned with exactly how many coins you have in your pocket. Rather, it’s concerned with how many coins you have in your pocket, how much credit you have with the local merchants, how much money you could borrow from friends and family, how much your assets are property are worth, etc. Resources reflects all of these things cumulatively.

Resources have their own section in Gold on pages 366-376. There are many Resources-specific mechanics that are important to know. But Resources are generally treated like a skill. You roll Resources when you have a Task come up that involves spending wealth as a means to achieve a relevant Intent.



##Y. How is weather handled in Burning Wheel?

Like most things in Burning Wheel, weather is only relevant if used in the context of driving play towards challenging a character’s Beliefs. Otherwise, it’s just flavor. There are no special rules for weather. If weather does come up, assign penalties based on it that make sense in the context of the Task being performed. If you need a reference, see pages 422-423 in Gold for the suggested weather penalties for Range & Cover.



##Z. How do wounds and recovery work?

When a character is injured in Burning Wheel, each wound the character takes is recorded individually on the character’s Physical Tolerance Grey Scale (PTGS), which is a linear set of coordinates created during character burning that reflects how resistant a character is to damage. Each of the seven wound types has a specific coordinate on a character's PTGS. And as a character takes wounds, they are recorded individually under their corresponding coordinate (e.g. If you take a Severe wound, that is recorded under the Severe wound coordinate).

While wounds are separate, wound effects are cumulative. Each type of wound adds a different penalty to a character's rolls that corresponds with its severity. These penalties range from +1Ob to -4D and affect everything that can be tested--stats, attributes, and skills. The only abilities unaffected by wound penalties are Health, Mortal Wound, Circles, Resources, and Emotional Attributes.

When a character has taken a combined die penalty equal to their lowest stat, they are incapacitated. If their lowest stat is a physical stat, they might still be conscious, but they will not be able to act. If their lowest stat is a mental stat, they are considered unconscious.

The Treatment and Recovery section has specific rules for each rule type of wound. But generally, treatment rolls are made to treat a wound, and then Health rolls are made to recover from it. This can easily take many months (or even years) in game time (a good opportunity for other characters to Practice). See pages 484-498 in Gold.

##AA. What are Speed Multipliers, and how do they work?

In Burning Wheel Gold, Speed Multipliers do nothing. They’re no longer part of the rules. Instead, they’ve been replaced by Stride. In Burning Wheel Revised, Speed Multipliers were an estimate of how many paces a character could take in a three-second period per each unit of their Speed exponent. So, humans have a 3.5x Speed Multiplier. This means that a Man with a B4 Speed could take around 14 (3.5 x 4) paces in a 3-second period of time.

The rule of thumb for converting Speed Multipliers to Stride is to double them. Men used to have a Speed Multiplier of 3.5x. Now they have a Stride of 7.



##BB. How does opening Grey and White-shade skills work?

Opening a Grey or White-shaded skill works just like any other skill: The exponent is half the root stat rounded down. It costs five points to shade shift an ability, but these points are not part of the ability’s total exponent. If a skill has a Grey or White-shaded root stat, then that skill is the same shade as its root at no additional cost.



##CC. How do untrained skills work in Duel of Wits?

Untrained skills in Duel of Wits works just like untrained skills in any other situation: You double the obstacle and don’t allow FoRKing. Any skill listed under the actions in Duel of Wits can be rolled by any character. In fact, this is a great way to get tests towards new social skills!



##DD. Is there a limit to how many skills a character can learn at once?

Nope. A character can learn as many skills as they can get tests for.
