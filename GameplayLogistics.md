# Gameplay Logistics


## A. What’s the best way to introduce a new player to Burning Wheel?


The best way to introduce a new player to Burning Wheel is by running them through a pre-written scenario for the game as a demo. The standbys are [The Sword](https://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/free-pdfs/the-sword-demo-adventure.html) and [Trouble in Hochen](https://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/twilight-in-the-duchy-verdorben.html). The Sword is somewhat PvP-focused, however, and Trouble in Hochen is generally considered to be the superior (though not perfect) adventure for this purpose.

Once a player has found that they are interested in playing Burning Wheel on a more long-term basis, it is essential to have them read the Hub & Spokes. The Rim is best avoided by new players until they grasp the core mechanics. Try to limit the game to just the basic rules at first, and then introduce the more advanced sub-systems one-by-one.


## B. What’s the easiest way to burn a character?

[Charred](https://charred.herokuapp.com/#/) offers the simplest way to make a character for Burning Wheel. [The Character Burner Worksheet](https://www.burningwheel.com/wiki/images/Character_Burner_worksheet.pdf) is next. Then there are the other online character burners, like [BW Gold Burner](https://bwgoldburner.appspot.com/) and the [Janklabs Lifepath Browser](http://janklabs.com/bwlp/). Finally, there’s following the book and doing it by hand. That said, character burning should occur as a group, and doing this by hand usually leads to more considered characters when burning with newer players.


## C. Where should I look for people to play Burning Wheel with?

Here are a few places to look if you’re trying to find people for a game:

[/r/BurningWheel](https://www.reddit.com/r/burningwheel) (Of course!)

[/r/lfg](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg)

[/r/roll20lfg](https://www.reddit.com/r/roll20lfg)

[Roll20](https://roll20.net/)

[The Official Forums](https://www.burningwheel.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?13-Player-Search)

[G+ Burning Wheel Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/101955942573794985122)

Unfortunately, however, Burning Wheel is a niche game. So, finding people with whom to play is always a challenge. The surest way to find a group is to take up the GMing reins yourself, and diving in head first! It’s much easier to find players and people willing to learn than it is to find a GM. Also, playing one-on-one is a good way to minimize the logistics of putting a game together.


## D. What’s the best medium for playing Burning Wheel?

Burning Wheel is intended to be played around a table in-person, and it shines when played in this way with your friends. That said, playing online works, and it works well. Roll20 offers the best online experience due to its custom Burning Wheel sheet. But any other voice/video solution can fill roughly the same role. Play-by-post is tougher due to the back-and-forth, conversational nature of the game. But it can work with the right expectations and the right players.


## E. What’s the right group size for Burning Wheel?

This depends mostly on the GM’s game management abilities. Generally, the game works best with 1-3 players. Every player added increases the number of Beliefs and Instincts that the GM has to incorporate by 3. So, the logistics of running Burning Wheel ramp up quickly with each player added. Also, Burning Wheel tends to be a more intimate RPG, and a crowded group can take away from this. When in doubt, start small.


## F. What’s a good base for a Burning Wheel campaign, or how should I start a Burning Wheel campaign?

Campaigns for Burning Wheel are crafted through collaboration between the GM and the players. There are no pre-written Burning Wheel campaigns; the game could not function as intended if the narrative was already decided. When creating a campaign for Burning Wheel, there are two major goals: Figure out where it’s going to take place, and figure out what the situation is.

The first thing to do when creating a campaign is to figure out what the Big Picture is. The GM might come to the table with a few loose ideas for what kind of game would be fun to play, and the players might as well. Figuring out which idea to use should be a frank discussion--everyone has to be excited by and buy into the concept. What you should end up with is a rough but structured idea of the type of world you’ll be playing in and the type of conflict you’ll be engaging with. An example from The Adventure Burner: “A land walked by gods who do not have the best interests of Men and beasts at heart.”

Once you have this, consider the tone of your game. Will it be dark, fantastical, somber, wondrous, historical, adventurous, or something else entirely? Your Big Picture will play into the answer heavily. This is the point where loose character concepts might begin to emerge. But these should be noted and put to the side for now.

Next, you need a situation. Situations are the conflicts at the hearts of campaigns. They must be interesting, wide-ranging enough for multiple characters to be engaged by them, non-linear enough for players to engage with them dynamically, and complicated enough that there are multiple possible ways to resolve them--none of them easy solutions. An example of a situation is the encroaching evil of the Dark Lord Sauron and the question of what to do with his rediscovered Ring of Power. The situation should also be created collaboratively with the GM leading this process. Branstorm, discuss, and compromise until everyone is happy with the outcome and excited by it.

Now is the time to wade into the details and decide exactly what kind of world your conflict is going to take place in. You already have the broad strokes. What is now needed are the culture, the environment, the type(s) of magic present, the currency, etc. As these things coalesce into the setting, you’ll want to consider which Lifepaths, stocks, and mechanics you’ll be including in your game. Hash these things out as a group until everyone is again satisfied. [Here are some questions Luke proposed to help this process along.](https://www.burningwheel.com/forum/showthread.php?4236-Setting-up-a-Burning-Wheel-campaign-world)

Finally, it’s time to make characters and decide on their initial Beliefs. Everyone should come up with a concept for their character that’s relevant to the situation and in keeping with the game world. Burn these characters as a group. Creating a character should be a communal process. Try to stick with the Lifepaths as written--make small modifications sparingly. Beliefs and Relationships should emerge during this process. The GM’s job is to take these things and mix them into the initial action that is going to kick off the game. How are the antagonists or the situation in general bringing the characters together and challenging their Beliefs?

Starting a campaign for Burning Wheel takes a lot of work up front. But once you have all the pieces on the table, it’s simple to put them together and start to play. Without these pieces--especially a strong situation--the game will flounder as it will lack the impetus to create actionable Beliefs that drive the action and the narrative forward. Conversely, a game with a strong foundation tends to drive itself forward.

Microscope by Ben Robbins is an excellent tool to assist with this process. Also, The Adventure Burner section of the supplement by the same name goes into all of the things mentioned here in much greater detail.


## G. How do you ensure that characters and mechanics stay balanced?

First, Burning Wheel isn’t made for balance. The game isn’t intended to be competitive between players, between the players and the GM, or between the players and the system. So traditional balance considerations have little bearing on Burning Wheel. Make characters that are appropriate for the story you want to tell. Sometimes, wizards adventure with mundane people, etc.

That said, ensuring that each player has roughly equivalent resources with which to make a character can be enforced by placing a hard limit on the number of Lifepaths available in character burning. Subtract one for Elves when mixing them with the other races if balance is particularly important. Orcs can sometimes be given extra Lifepaths (if so desired) due to their required Die of Fate roll. But ultimately, if the group is okay with characters being a little unbalanced, it won’t break the game.


## H. What’s the best way to handle min/maxing in Burning Wheel?

Mix/maxing isn’t much of a worry in Burning Wheel because of how the Lifepath system distributes points during character burning. But it’s best to ensure that every character’s stats are at least 3 due to how incapacitation works. And if playing with characters having 4 or fewer Lifepaths, each character’s highest skill exponent should be 5 or 6 and limited to just one skill unless they want to be generally incompetent.


## I. Is an alternative setting appropriate for a first Burning Wheel game?

Absolutely! Any of the alternative settings work just as well as the fantasy setting included in Burning Wheel Gold. Just keep in mind that most of the alternative settings were written for Burning Wheel Classic and Burning Wheel Revised, so some things may need to be converted to Gold (which isn’t difficult).


## J. How should I prep for Burning Wheel?

Generally, the answer is that you don’t. Burning Wheel is a game that requires little to no prep because the players determine what the story will be about, and what will happen in a given session is almost entirely driven by the players forming Intents and Tasks that the GM can’t easily anticipate. Burning NPCs who are significant to the story is the only real exception to this rule. Reading your players’ Beliefs and Instincts and thinking about how you might challenge them is the best way to ready yourself for play. [Bangs can help with this process.](https://www.burningwheel.com/forum/showthread.php?1457-Running-with-Bangs)

(**Bangs should probably be discussed separately and in more detail.**)


## K. How should I explain Beliefs to new players?

Beliefs can be a difficult to explain to new players. First, go over the game’s basic mechanics and explain that Beliefs are their way of expressing their priorities for the game. Beliefs let them tell the GM what the story should be about and how the game should move forward. If it still isn’t clicking, then have them read some of the Belief workshops found on the official forums and the wiki:

[Beliefs Workshop with Thor](https://www.burningwheel.com/forum/showthread.php?9292-Trying-to-explain-Beliefs-in-a-concrete-way-to-my-group&p=92402#post92402)

[Beliefs Workshops on the Wiki](https://www.burningwheel.com/wiki/index.php?title=Belief_workshop)

If it still isn’t clicking for them, just be patient and persistent. Play a demo or two. Have them read an actual play. Sometimes experience with Beliefs is what’s necessary to understand them. Sometimes understanding them comes in stages. It’ll happen.

(**I'm sure there's more to say about this**)

## L. What are the best pre-written scenarios for Burning Wheel?

[Twilight in the Duchy Verdorben](https://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/twilight-in-the-duchy-verdorben.html), [The Sword](https://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/free-pdfs/the-sword-demo-adventure.html), and the adventures found in The Adventure Burner are the go-to official adventures for Burning Wheel. [Words Remain Below](https://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/words-remain-below.html) is another great adventure. Unfortunately, due to the nature of how the game is played, pre-written scenarios aren’t ideal for playing the gamel. A short, low-pressure campaign designed by the group may be a better alternative if you have the time and the buy-in.


## M. How can I add a fifth player to The Sword?

Don’t. Just run Trouble in Hochen instead. It’s a better introduction and can already accommodate up to six players. But if you really want to run The Sword with more than four players, make a four-Lifepath wizard, priest, or fighter. [Here’s Luke and others discussing this problem](https://www.burningwheel.com/forum/showthread.php?1947-5th-character-idea-for-quot-The-Sword-quot&highlight=character+sword).


## N. How can I speed up Fight!?

It depends on what’s specifically dragging it out. But generally, armor is what makes Fight! run long. Non-damaging attacks--like Charge, Push, and (especially) Lock--are good choices against an armored opponent because armor doesn’t stop them. [See this thread for thoughts on the issue](https://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/free-pdfs/burning-wheel-gold-hub-and-spokes.html).


## O. Is older content, like The Blossoms Are Falling, compatible with Burning Wheel Gold?

Yes, absolutely. Older material is still fully compatible with Gold. It just needs a little tweaking. Speed multipliers should be doubled to become Stride. Some traits may operate slightly differently. The PTGS is a circle in classic instead of a table, but it works the same way. There are other, little things, but nothing major is preventing old material from being used with the rules from Gold.

(**More could be said about this**)


## P. What’s the best way to handle giving NPCs Artha?

Give NPCs Artha as you need to, as they legitimately earn it, or just skip giving them Artha altogether. An NPC with Artha should be the exception by far, not the rule. Do what works best for your particular situation and game, and don’t let NPC Artha slow you down or get in the way. Artha is about the PCs.


## Q. How do I ensure that my games remain focused and narratively-driven?

Burning Wheel requires a situation--a conflict that engages every character. Without a situation, players can’t write actionable Beliefs and drive the story forward. If you find your game stagnating and meandering, ask yourself what the action of the story is supposed to be moving towards. And if you can’t answer that question, then you need a situation. If you don’t know that the game is about taking the One Ring to Mount Doom, then your players can’t write long-term Beliefs to move the game towards that goal, and you can’t move the game towards challenging those Beliefs. Similarly, if your game doesn’t have an immediate conflict, then your players can’t write short-term Beliefs, and you won’t have anything to drive the session towards. Burning Wheel is not a system that works with sandbox-style play. It's possible for these things to emerge during a session, but don't expect them to.


## R. Do I need the supplements for Revised, and what’s in them?

No. The Revised supplements are not necessary to play Burning Wheel. Furthermore, with the impending release of The Codex, their relevance is waning. But if you want to check them out, here’s what you’ll find in them:

The Monster Burner contains processes for creating creatures, Lifepaths, traits, skills, stocks, and monstrous magic. It contains a bestiary, skills and trait to use with monstrous characters, and discussions of attributes, shades, and using monsters in play. Finally, it contains Lifepaths for Trolls, Roden, Great Wolves, and Great Spiders. The Monster Burner is the book to get if you want to make custom content for Burning Wheel and/or expand the stocks available to you.

The Magic Burner contains thirteen alternative magic systems for use in Burning Wheel, including a system for creating sorcerous spells on-the-fly. It also contains thoughts on playing magical characters, a list of magical artifacts, magical Lifepaths, and a magic burner for creating magic systems. If you want to expand on or beyond Burning Wheel’s sorcerous magic system or introduce a different kind of magic into your game, the Magic Burner is for you.

The Adventure Burner contains "The Adventure Burner," which is a process for putting together the setting, the situation, the characters, and the other bits and pieces of a Burning Wheel game. It also contains three pre-written adventures (only one of which isn’t available for free from the BWHQ store). It contains The Crucible, which is a collection of pre-gen characters. And finally, it contains The Commentary, which is an extensive discussion of almost every aspect of Burning Wheel that expands on and explains all the gears that make the game turn. The Adventure Burner is a great addition to any Burning Wheel GM’s collection. But everything other than The Crucible and the unreleased adventure will be available in The Codex. So, this information will be easily obtainable after August 2016.


## S. What options are available for combat, and when should they be used?

There are three types of combat resolution systems in Burning Wheel:


### Standard/Versus Tests

Much like any other conflict in Burning Wheel, combat can be resolved with a single Intent and Task: “I want to stab him through the heart and kill him!!” If a particular scene’s combat encounter isn’t important enough to the story to spend much time resolving it, a single Standard or Versus test is perfectly acceptable.


### Bloody Versus Tests

Bloody Versus tests are an alternative to using plain Versus tests to quickly resolve combat. Combat is still resolved in a single test, but each character rolls dice pools for both attack and defense. The rules for Bloody Versus, including how to build the dice pools and how to resolve the test are found on pages 426-427 in Gold. The resolution of a Bloody Versus test depends on whether one side hits, both sides hit, or neither side hits.


### Fight

Fight is the detailed combat system for Burning Wheel. It is a blow-by-blow breakdown of deadly, martial conflict. Much like Duel of Wits and Range & Cover, Fight involves two sides picking three sequential actions from a list of several possible actions which are then revealed simultaneously and resolved one-by-one.

For example, your actions might be “Strike-Block-Push,” while your opponent’s actions might be “Avoid-Charge-Strike.” First, Strike is resolved against Avoid. Then Block against Charge. And finally, Push against Strike. If the fight has not ended by the resolution of the third pair, three new actions are picked in secret by each side, and the process begins again. The interactions between each possible pair of actions in Fight are specific and explained throughout the Fight chapter.

Despite being an almost entirely separate game from the rest of Burning Wheel, Fight still relies on Intent and Task to resolve each interaction. Skills are still used, and dice pools are still formed and rolled. Almost every test is a Versus test of some kind.

The rules for Fight are, perhaps, the densest part of Burning Wheel. They are meant to be used for combat that is supremely important within the context of a game’s story. This is what you break out for the climactic showdown between the PCs and the Dark Lord, not what you use to kill a random group of bandits. The decision to use the Fight rules is a decision to potentially see a PC die in combat and should not be taken lightly. Don't break out Fight for new players.


## T. What stops players from test mongering?

Roll the Dice or Say Yes is the GM’s greatest defense against test mongering. If the potential test isn’t relevant to the narrative, to the character’s Beliefs and/or doesn’t have an interesting failure condition--if something isn't being risked--there’s no reason to roll. Even the most dire of situations can be resolved without a test. Don’t let players pressure you into testing when a test isn’t called for. Test when the moment is dramatically appropriate and means something.


## U. How do I pick the right skill for a test?

Determining the right skill for a test is a question of how the player describes their Task. The skill rolled should reflect the actions that the character is taking to achieve the player’s Intent. The player can suggest a skill. But ultimately, the skill that is rolled is up to the GM based on their interpretation of the Task. Reading through the Skills section of Gold periodically is a helpful exercise to familiarize yourself with the skills the game has to offer.

If you can’t think of a skill from the book, or if nothing seems appropriate to the Task as described, it’s perfectly acceptable to make up a skill on the spot. Also, don’t be afraid to take some time and glance through the skill section in the book. Just don’t let your game be bogged down by stressing over picking the perfect skill for a test.


## V. What’s the best way to handle loot?

Loot is only relevant in Burning Wheel as it relates to the story and to players’ Beliefs. The Magic Burner has a great list of magical items in the Artifacts section. But even these should only be introduced when they’re relevant to what’s going on in the narrative. Taking items and equipment from players as a condition for failure can be a powerful tool. And to do this, they must be given those items and equipment in the first place. But Burning Wheel isn’t a game about stuff. It’s a game about the cool things that you do with your stuff. Don’t let yourself get caught up in the idea that because Burning Wheel is an RPG, loot is a necessary part of the game--it’s not. Give loot out when doing so helps move the game in an interesting and relevant direction.
